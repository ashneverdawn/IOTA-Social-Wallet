# IOTA-Social-Wallet

An iota smart social wallet. Open source of course, with tutorials. The goal is to have a place to bring the people together that is fully integrated in the iota network. It is in the form of a static website, so very lightweight, fast, and portable. No need for a backend or database, so can be easily run locally or easily hosted for free or cheap. Can be embedded in a wrapper for deployment to different platforms, such as iPhone and Android. In addition to expected wallet features and functionality, you can save addresses as contacts.  You can send payment requests/invoices to your contacts. You can also send mail messages to these contacts. You can create/join chat rooms. Also the wallet will have an integrated faucet. People can donate to the faucet. New users trying out iota can get a small amount of free iota automatically from the faucet.
